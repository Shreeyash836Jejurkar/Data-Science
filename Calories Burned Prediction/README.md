# Calories Burned Prediction
---


## Overview

* Data of 15000 observation of calories burned based on 6 factors. [datasets here](https://www.kaggle.com/fmendes/fmendesdat263xdemos)
* Eliminated the factors which were not strongly correlated for model creation. 
* Created two models linear and quadratic based on observations.
